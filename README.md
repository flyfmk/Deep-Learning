# Deep-Learning
Implementation of Deep Learning algorithms into a simple Python framework.

New algorithms will be implemented when I get a good grasp on those algorithms.

Implemented Algorithms:

    Deep L ANN:

        Forward Propagation using he/Xavier/random initialization, Normalization.

        Binary Cross entropy loss, Regularization.

        Backword Propagation.
        
        Gradient Descent.
